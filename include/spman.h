/**
 * Allocates a pattern for sprite `type` using `data`.
 *
 * `len` specifies the number of sprite patterns to allocate (16x16 each,
 * exactly 32 bytes).
 *
 * If `flip` is set to a non zero value, the pattern data will be flipped
 * horizontally.
 *
 * The function returns the allocated index in the pattern table, than can be
 * used in [struct sprite_attr](ubox-lib-ref.html#struct-sprite_attr). It
 * can be called multiple times for the same `type` and the allocation happens
 * only once per `type`, returning the previously allocated index.
 *
 * `type` is an abstraction to group patterns. For example, if our game's
 * player character has 3 animation frames per horizontal direction, we could
 * use two different types to group those.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```c
 * enum sprite_types
 * {
 *   SPRITE_PLAYER = 0,
 *   SPRITE_PLAYER_FLIP,
 *   SPRITE_ENEMY,
 * }:
 *
 * spman_alloc_pat(SPRITE_PLAYER, player_sprite, 3, 0);
 * // allocate the same frames flipped horizontally, on the next type
 * spman_alloc_pat(SPRITE_PLAYER_FLIP, player_sprite, 3, 1);
 *
 * // only one frame, keep the allocated pattern
 * uint8_t enemy_pat = spman_alloc_pat(SPRITE_ENEMY, enemy_sprite, 1, 0);
 * ```
 *
 * A `type` can't be reused with a different pattern, [spman_init](#spman_init)
 * has to be called again to free all the patterns.
